# Sentiment Analysis of twitter data
This project constitutes analyzing tweets using the "Sentiment140" dataset by Stanford. 
The model uses machine learning algorithms and feature extraction techniques to characterize a tweet as either positive or negative.

The linked jupyter notebooks are as follows:

* [First.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/First.ipynb) - Preparation and cleaning of the dataset

* [Second.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Second.ipynb) - Analysis, visualisation and preparing the data for further visualisation

* [Third.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Third.ipynb) - Zipf Law and visualisation of tweet tokens

* [Fourth.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Fourth.ipynb) - Split the dataset, took TextBlob sentiment 
analyzer as the Baseline, feature extraction using CountVectorizer and Logistic Regression based classification model applied on 
unigrams, bigrams and trigrams

* [Fifth.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Fifth.ipynb) - Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Logistic 
Regression based classification model applied on unigrams, bigrams and trigrams and analysed the performance of other classification 
algorithms like Ridge Classifier, Perceptron, Passive-Agressive Classifier, Stochastic Gradient Descent, LinearSVC,
L1 based LinearSVC, KNN, Nearest Centroid, Multinomial NB, Bernoulli NB & Adaboost

* [Sixth.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Sixth.ipynb) - Implemented Doc2Vec model using Gensim for
feature extraction. Used DBOW (Distributed Bag Of Words), DMC (Distributed Memory Concatenated), DMM (Distributed Memory Mean), 
DBOW + DMC & DBOW + DMM on unigrams

* [Seventh.ipynb](https://github.com/rkritika1508/Sentiment-Analysis/blob/master/Seventh.ipynb) - Implemented Phrase Modelling using Gensim. 
Implemented DBOW, DMC, DMM, DBOW + DMC & DBOW + DMM on bigrams and trigrams. Also implemented other classification algorithms on the dataset
